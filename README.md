## Setup

To setup the project you have to run the `setup.bat` provided in the scripts directory.

- It creates a virtuell environment called ".venv" and installs all dependencies in it. \

- It also installs the project as a package in Edit Mode so that you can better work with the top level imports.


If something changes in the configuration, it is enough to run the `setup.bat` script again.
